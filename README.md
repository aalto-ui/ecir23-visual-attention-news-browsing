# 1. Set up virtual environment

Create virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv .env

Activate virtual environment:

    source .env/bin/activate

Install required packages

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Deactivate virtual environment

    deactivate

## 2. Check raw data

The folder paths are configured in ```CONFIG.py```. The data is read from ```data/01-fit-data/filter=True``` by default (make sure to add the data file here). The columns in the data can be interpreted as follows:

| Name | Definition                |
|------|---------------------------|
| y    | visit time                |
| N    | # observations            |
| i    | indicator for picture     |
| d    | indicator for description |
| K    | number of groups          |
| x    | group indicator           | 

Note that data is given for three foveal areas (number at the end of the file name indicating radii). To change which file is read, change ```RADIUS``` in ```CONFIG.py```.

## 3. Fit the models

Model fitting can be run using the following command:

    python3 -m src.fit

This will also take a couple of minutes. Results of model fitting are saved as a text file to ```data/02-results/fitting_results_separate.csv``` and ```data/02-results/fitting_results_separatecovariate.csv```.

## 4. Examine results

The results can be examined using the notebook ```notebooks/stan-plots```. The produced plots are saved to ```data/02-results```. Figures 3 and 4 from the paper are re-produced here. 

## Some notes

Note that some of the variables in the repository are named differently to the paper. For instance, the shape ```k=alpha``` and the scale ```sigma=lambda``` to convey to the Stan documentation. The covariate for picture ```p=i```, as to not confuse it with an index in the written paper. The Stan code for the model is saved in ```src/models/weibull.py```.
